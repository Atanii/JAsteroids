# JAsteroids

Clone of the famous classic in pure Java.

I made this project last year as a learning project. I used technics like SAT (Separating Axes Theorem) and evenâ€“odd rule algorithm.

## More info about these methods:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon

## Controls:
- WASD : move
- SPACE : shoot
- H : homing missile targetting random asteroid

## Known bugs, glitches:
- sometimes asteroids generated at the same coordinates as player or at least they intersect
- the rotating movement is not perfect
